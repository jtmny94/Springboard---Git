    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1``\\n    provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of the infinite population.\\n    ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for\\n    normally distributed variables. The standard deviation computed in this\\n    function is the square root of the estimated variance, so even with\\n    ``ddof=1``, it will not be an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation\\n    per se.\\n\\n    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute\\n    value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.\\n\\n    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same\\n    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause\\n    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example below).\\n    Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can\\n    alleviate this issue.\\n\\n    Examples\\n    --------\\n    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\\n    >>> np.std(a)\\n    1.1180339887498949 # may vary\\n    >>> np.std(a, axis=0)\\n    array([1.,  1.])\\n    >>> np.std(a, axis=1)\\n    array([0.5,  0.5])\\n\\n    In single precision, std() can be inaccurate:\\n\\n    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)\\n    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0\\n    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1\\n    >>> np.std(a)\\n    0.45000005\\n\\n    Computing the standard deviation in float64 is more accurate:\\n\\n    >>> np.std(a, dtype=np.float64)\\n    0.44999999925494177 # may vary\\n\\n    Specifying a where argument:\\n\\n    >>> a = np.array([[14, 8, 11, 10], [7, 9, 10, 11], [10, 15, 5, 10]])\\n    >>> np.std(a)\\n    2.614064523559687 # may vary\\n    >>> np.std(a, where=[[True], [True], [False]])\\n    2.0\\n\\n    \""

    "In this section, you've been introduced to the scipy.stats package and used it to draw a small sample from the standard normal distribution. You've calculated the average (the mean) of this sample and seen that this is not exactly equal to the expected population parameter (which we know because we're generating the random variates from a specific, known distribution). You've been introduced to two ways of calculating the standard deviation; one uses $n$ in the denominator and the other uses $n-1$ (Bessel's correction). You've also seen which of these calculations np.std() performs by default and how to get it to generate the other."

    "You use $n$ as the denominator if you want to calculate the standard deviation of a sequence of numbers. You use $n-1$ if you are using this sequence of numbers to estimate the population parameter. This brings us to some terminology that can be a little confusing.\n",

    "The population parameter is traditionally written as $\\sigma$ and the sample statistic as $s$. Rather unhelpfully, $s$ is also called the sample standard deviation (using $n-1$) whereas the standard deviation of the sample uses $n$. That's right, we have the sample standard deviation and the standard deviation of the sample and they're not the same thing!\n",

    "as you have complete, full knowledge of your population. In other words, your sample _is_ your population. It's worth noting that we're dealing with what Professor Spiegehalter describes on p. 92 of *AoS* as a **metaphorical population**: we have all the data, and we act as if the data-point is taken from a population at random. We can think of this population as an imaginary space of possibilities. \n",

    "If, however, you have sampled _from_ your population, you only have partial knowledge of the state of your population. In this case, the standard deviation of your sample is not an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation of the population, in which case you seek to estimate that population parameter via the sample standard deviation, which uses the $n-1$ denominator."

    "So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*). For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n",

    "This is important because typically we are dealing with samples from populations and all we know about the population is what we see in the sample. From this sample, we want to make inferences about the population. We may do this, for example, by looking at the histogram of the values and by calculating the mean and standard deviation (as estimates of the population parameters), and so we are intrinsically interested in how these quantities vary across samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, now that we've taken one sample of size $n$ and made some claims about the general population, what if we were to take another sample of size $n$? Would we get the same result? Would we make the same claims about the general population? This brings us to a fundamental question: _when we make some inference about a population based on our sample, how confident can we be that we've got it 'right'?_\n",

    "Now, the standard normal distribution (with its variance equal to its standard deviation of one) would not be a great illustration of a key point. Instead, let's imagine we live in a town of 50,000 people and we know the height of everyone in this town. We will have 50,000 numbers that tell us everything about our population. We'll simulate these numbers now and put ourselves in one particular town, called 'town 47', where the population mean height is 172 cm and population standard deviation is 5 cm."

(**Check out p. 199 of AoS if you need to revise this**). This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places. In reality this is simply a rule of thumb; if the underlying distribution is approximately normal then your sampling distribution will already be pretty normal, but if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed then you'd want to increase your sample size."
